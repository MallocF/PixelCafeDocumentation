    \subsection{Scenery shot}
    \noindent Upon a player joining after they are done loading their camera should be placed looking at an
    location of an \emph{custom build} map. Adding blurs and other visual effects is \textcolor{mediocerColor}{optional}.
    Their should be multiple versions of the map depending on the season, ie if it's winter a snowy version of the map
    should be loaded in, and if it's summer or some other season or an event like hallowen the map should be loaded to fit the mood.

    \subsection{UI for the Main Menu}
    \noindent The next list will show all the options the main menu will have to have...

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \itemizeListDisplay{Party UI}
        \item \itemizeListDisplay{Store UI}
        \item \itemizeListDisplay{Trade UI}
        \item \itemizeListDisplay{Leaderboard / Rank UI}
        \label{list:MainMenuUI}
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Party UI}

    \noindent The party UI is a group of UI's that should give the player options to:
    \vspace{5mm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \itemizeListDisplay{Create parties}
        \item \itemizeListDisplay{Invite players to parties}
        \item \itemizeListDisplay{Remove players from parties}
        \item \itemizeListDisplay{Start a game with your party}
        \item \itemizeListDisplay{Join friend}
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{5mm}
    \noindent When creating parties the party maker/creator should be allowed to make it an \textcolor{green}{opened} or
    \textcolor{red}{closed} party. If the party is open then it will be displayed for everyone to see and join, however if the party is closed then
    only the party creator can invite other players that \textcolor{importantColor}{aren't} in a party.
    \textcolor{importantColor}{Only the party creator} can kick / remove players from his party. And finally
    upon pressing play the game should teleport everyone in the party to the desired location, if the teleport fails
    the players are to be informed of the failed teleport. When creating a party the player will be presented with more then just one
    option to make the party opened or closed. The next list will show you all the options the player will be promted upon making a party.
    \vspace{2mm}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \itemizeListDisplay{Party Type}
        \item \itemizeListDisplay{Friends can join session}
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{3mm}
    \noindent If the party is an open type it will get a few more \textcolor{moneyColor}{bonus} option... such as
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \itemizeListDisplay{Minimum Level Requierment}
        \item \itemizeListDisplay{Minimum Days Survived}
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent Keep in mind that all of these bonus options are \textcolor{importantColor}{OPTIONAL}.

    \subsubsection{Store and Trade UI's}
    \noindent Before reading about these UI's it will come in \emph{handy} if you check out the \colorLink{noteColor}{Section:Player Data}{Player Data} section.
